there are 3 main python files

main - the A2C machine learning training env
PPO - the PPO machine learning training env
Checkperformance - checks the Bestmodel file

if you run checkperformance, it will show the best model from any of the training session (Default is ppo_tuned, which is the best solution)
to check other performances, you need to change the loadmodel to one of the other "BestModel" folder.
